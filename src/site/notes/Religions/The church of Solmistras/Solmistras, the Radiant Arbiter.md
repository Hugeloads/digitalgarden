#### **Lore**

Solmistras is the divine avatar of **unyielding, order**—a celestial force that wages eternal war against demons, devils, and all who threaten the sanctity of the cosmos. His followers preach that **law and light must prevail at all costs**, believing that the ends always justify the means. In their quest to eradicate darkness, they have become **oppressive zealots**, branding all chaotic forces as evil, even when those forces fight against true darkness.

While the world sees Solmistras as a **beacon of righteousness**, the deeper truth is more sinister. His church is **merciless**—burning entire cities suspected of demon worship, forcing magical bloodlines into servitude, and condemning free thought as heresy. Sorcerers, warlocks, and those touched by the Abyss are among their most **hunted enemies**.

Your character, as a demonic sorcerer, would be a prime target for the **Church of Solmistras**—an order of militant inquisitors and flame-cloaked knights who see **your power as an abomination**. But perhaps you have uncovered something **deeper**: a truth that reveals the church itself is rotten, its divine light a cage rather than salvation.
