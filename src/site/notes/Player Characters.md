Player Characters need to have the following: 
- A Goal

- A backstory with something unresolved that drives the character to want to achieve their goal. 

- A Family they come from. (Who was Mom/Dad and where are they now.)

- A Land they Hail from. 

- Find one low level magical Item or create one for your character and run it by me. 

- If you want help making the item feel free to msg me. 

- Any other ties you want to have/characters you know that can be added to the story. 

- A reason to be looking for work in in a small town in the [[World/Families/GrandFell/GrandFell\|GrandFell]] Province.

- We are starting at Level 3.
