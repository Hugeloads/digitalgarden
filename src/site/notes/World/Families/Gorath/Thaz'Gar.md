Thaz'Gar son of Thaz'Gahr is the current ruler of [[World/Families/Gorath/Rakkarn/Rakkarn\|Rakkarn]] which is so named after the King of the orcs Gorath. 

Often [[World/Families/Gorath/Thaz'Gar\|Thaz'Gar]]'s outbursts in the council often get him removed from council hearings. 
He is not fond of this and often attacks a neighboring village in retaliation of whichever councilor made him angry. Peace is often restruck and tensions resolved.
