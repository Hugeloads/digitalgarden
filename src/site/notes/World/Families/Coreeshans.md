The remnants of a once great people destroyed by the [[World/History/The Crimson Engagements\|The Crimson Engagements]] 200 years ago. Those who lived after the war were subject to prejudice and malice by the populations of the Claim Lands. Many went into hiding or changed their identities. Their marked Orange eye color gives them away. 
Some Coreeshans believe their empire might one day return but most are recovering after the war trying to make a new life in their now strange homeland.
