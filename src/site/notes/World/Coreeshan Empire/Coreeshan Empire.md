An empire which, at its height, was unmatched in magical knowledge and Arcane Technology. With the Abundant Magical resources found within [[World/Zendel\|Zendel]] this Land was poised to host the worlds largest power and the Coreeshans Exploited that. 
In recent years the Empire had begun to waiver under salacious rumors of infighting and tales of a horrible power being seized. Believed by most to simply be an internal coo gone wrong. This weakness in the great empire saw that all its opponents would take advantage and destroy the empire. Each vining for claim over the believed arcane rich soil and knowledge that permeated the lands. 
The Final stand of the Coreeshan Empire happened in [[World/Families/Barrowel/Valoreia/Valoreia\|Valoreia]] Which is now controlled by the [[World/Families/Barrowel/Barrowel\|Barrowel]] Family.
